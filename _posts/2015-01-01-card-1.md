<a href="http://uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oregon</a> is a flagship public research university. As the *Government Information Specialist*(Librarian) I worked the Digital Scholarship Center as well as Oregon Government Agency partners (ODOT<a href= http://www.oregon.gov/odot/pages/index.aspx>, DLCD<a href=http://www.oregon.gov/lcd/Pages/index.aspx>)to collect, preserve, and make available local government information through the Local and Regional Document Archive<a href=https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/7549>>  In addition, I use my expertise in Local, State, Regional and International government information sources to support and futher the research goals of the university through my liason relationship with the Planning, Public Policy and Management Program students, faculty and the wider Oregon community. I also teach a credit bearing course on Data Management for Social Science research and use data science methods, tools and concepts to provide unique services and collections.  Some of my current projects include Topic Modeling to enhance access to library collects, and using R to create data sets and visualizations<a href="https://github.com/UODocCenter/990sandEOBMFmerged" target="_blank">IRS Data</a>.
